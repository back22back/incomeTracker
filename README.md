# IncomeTracker
Solo Project: In two days developed a minimalistic Full-Stack application to keep track of income and spendings.

# Front Page
At the front page, users can choose to either input an income or spending, category, specific name of the ocassion, and the amount. Below the form is a brief summary of both the incomes and spendings and a total to indicate the net gain for the month(or net loss).

# Analysis
Upon clicking the Analysis page from the menu dropdown, the user is displayed a pie chart of the breakdown analysis by category. The user can choose to see either the Income breakdown or the Expense breakdown. Upon clicking each category in the pie chart, a list of all the spendings in that category will be displayed below to allow users to see exactly what is costing/earning them the most amount of money.
